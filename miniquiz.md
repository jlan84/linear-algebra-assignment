### This miniquiz is optional
If you feel at all unsure about your linear algebra skills, your time will be better spent reading [this](https://github.com/zipfian/precourse/blob/master/Chapter_2_Linear_Algebra/notes.md) and [this](https://github.com/zipfian/linear-algebra-eda/blob/master/linear_algebra_exampes.ipynb). (By read, I mean run and understand each code block)

## Miniquiz: Probability Practice

**Include your code and answers in** `miniquiz.py`.

1. Let's say we play a game where I keep flipping a coin until I get heads.
   If the first time I get heads is on the nth coin, then I pay you 2n-1 dollars.
   How much would you pay me to play this game for us to break even in the
   long term? Show your work.

2. Write a program to simulate the game and verify that your answer is correct.
